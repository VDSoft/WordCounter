## Questions for Product Owner (PO)

When the operation to count all words in a text is canceled how should the system behave?
  a) The system should return all words with their count up until the point the operation was canceled
  b) The system should return nothing

PO decision
To keep the system simple we will return nothing and the client which uses the system has to decide what to do.
